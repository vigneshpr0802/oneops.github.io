`https://<your-server>/services/organization/search.json?ns_path=/services&class_name=manifest.Lb`

## GET a list of bom (operations) Lb components
`https://<your-server>/services/organization/search.json?ns_path=/services&class_name=bom.Lb`

## GET a list of bom Fqdn components
`https://<your-server>/services/organization/search.json?ns_path=/services&class_name=bom.Fqdn`

## GET a list of all bom Computes
`https://<your-server>/services/organization/search.json?ns_path=/services&class_name=bom.Compute`

## GET a Compute by IP Address
 `https://<your-server>/<ORGANIZATION-NAME>/organization/search.json?source=es&query=ciAttributes.private_ip:<IP>`

## GET a list of all environments
`https://<your-server>/services/organization/search.json?ns_path=/services&package=manifest&class_name=manifest.Environment`
`Add: attr_name=<name>  and attr_value=<value>`

# Account Profile

## GET Auth Token via UI in your browswer (not via curl or api)

`https://<your-server>/account/profile#authentication`

Sample curl using the auth-token:

```sh
curl -i -u <AUTH-TOKEN>: -H "Content-Type:application/json" -H "Accept:application/json" -X GET -v https://<your-server>/account/organizations
```

# Organization

## GET all organizations
`https://<your-server>/account/organizations`

## GET clouds
`https://<your-server>/<ORGANIZATION-NAME>/clouds`

## GET cloud by name
`https://<your-server>/<ORGANIZATION-NAME>/clouds/<CLOUD-NAME>`

## POST cloud by name
`https://<your-server>/<ORGANIZATION-NAME>/clouds`

## GET Supported locations
`https://<your-server>/<ORGANIZATION-NAME>/clouds/locations.json`

## GET Supported Services
`https://<your-server>/<ORGANIZATION-NAME>/clouds/<CLOUD-NAME>/services/available.json`

## GET Cloud Service By Name
`https://<your-server>/<ORGANIZATION-NAME>/clouds/<CLOUD-NAME>/services/<SERVICE-NAME>`

## POST New Service
First fetch the new service body content using:

`https://<your-server>/<ORGANIZATION-NAME>/clouds/<CLOUD-NAME>/services/<SERVICE-NAME>/new.json`

Then:

```
POST: https://<your-server>/<ORGANIZATION-NAME>/clouds/<CLOUD-NAME>/services/
Body: Take the response from new call and update all necessary fields/attributes to create body
```

## PUT Update to Service

First fetch the new service body content using:

`https://<your-server>/<ORGANIZATION-NAME>/clouds/<CLOUD-NAME>/services/<SERVICE-NAME>`

Then:

```
PUT https://<your-server>/<ORGANIZATION-NAME>/clouds/<CLOUD-NAME>/services/<SERVICE-NAME>
Body: Take the response from get call and update all necessary fields/attributes to create body
```

## GET Compute report

`https://<your-server>/<ORGANIZATION-NAME>/reports/compute.json`

The response has two major sections:

- One describes metrics metadata.
- One has the data itself in hierarchal form.
- A third describes scope. Because scope is different for different reports, if you want to run the report by cloud rather than by assembly, you pass extra param in the url. For example:

`https://<your-server>/<ORGANIZATION-NAME>/reports/compute.json?grouping=cloud`

# Assembly
